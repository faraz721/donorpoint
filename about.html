    <h3 class="headings">What is DonorPoint?</h3>
    <p class="details">
      DonorPoint is a community-driven blood donation platform built to make a real difference. It connects people who urgently need blood with generous donors in their local area. 
      Our goal is to save lives by removing the delay and difficulty in finding the right donor at the right time. We understand that during emergencies, every second counts—and that’s why DonorPoint was created.
    </p>

    <h3 class="headings">Why Was This Website Made?</h3>
    <p class="details">
      This website was designed with simplicity and compassion in mind. Many people struggle to find blood donors during emergencies, especially in smaller cities or under-resourced hospitals.
      DonorPoint aims to fill that gap. It gives users the ability to either become a donor or quickly search for someone who matches the blood type they need. The platform is light, fast, easy to use on all devices, and made for everyone — young or old.
    </p>

    <h3 class="headings">Why Blood Donation Matters?</h3>
    <p class="details">
      Blood donation is one of the most selfless acts a person can do. It helps accident victims, surgery patients, mothers during childbirth, and people battling chronic illnesses like cancer or anemia. 
      Your one donation can save up to three lives — and you might never know how many lives you’ve truly touched.
